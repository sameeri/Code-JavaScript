Dearest Sameeri,

There are a lot of languages to choose from and over the years your love for me has increased! Since my birth, due to different vendors, I have been implemented differently and caused pain to many. I have been cursed many a time.. Yet people stuck with me.. , for they understood it was not my mistake but the mistake of the implementations. 
	Your love for me has grown with awesome people like Crockford, Resig and the likes trying to spread more love for me by teaching you the actual me. But, do you know me well enough?  Do you love me soo.. that you would actually spend time understanding me and my value to the world. Do you love me soo.. that you would talk to the world about me.. and treat me with so much affection as much as you would with other languages.. Anywaysâ€¦ I just wanted to tell you I love you and I will be always there for you.. Whatever program you would like to write..   

Hugs to you my friend!

Lots of Love & Best Wishes,
